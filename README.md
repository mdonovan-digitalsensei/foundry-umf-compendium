# foundry-umf-compendium
This is a very rough and dirty attempt to try and get some of Urban Modern Fantasy into the dungeonworld system created for Foundry VTT

You can get the rule book here https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/297607/Urban-Modern-Fantasy

I'll note that this is a homebrew version of that for my game group so it's a hack of a hack of a hack and I've put this up here to make my life easier.

I make no promises about it being maintained or updated in the future, but it will for as long as I find the system interesting and playable.

Cheers,
MD
