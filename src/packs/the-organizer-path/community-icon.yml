    <p>You are a pillar of your community, well-known and respected.
    People come to you for advice and to settle conflicts, and will
    generally abide by your decisions. Choose two.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>you may have a second non-conflicting goal from For a Cause</li> 
    <li>you each hold 2 when you use Role Model</li> 
    <li>choose another social group for the purposes of Community Member.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>If you have From the Neighborhood, choose marks for each
