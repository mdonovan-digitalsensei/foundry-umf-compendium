  description: >-
    <p>When you roll 12+ while Defying Danger, you may add a talent
    to your sheet that reflects the action you succeeded on. Ask
    the GM what that talent is.</p>
    <p>When you trigger a roll and a talent applies and would help,
    take +1 to the roll. You can only use one talent’s bonus on any
    given roll.</p>
    <p>Talents don’t change if a Move triggers; just because you
    have Talent [Lie Blatantly About Time] doesn’t mean you
    can convince someone who can see the sun that it’s midnight.
    It just means that if you’ve triggered a roll, like Defy Danger,
    and it happens to involve a bald-faced lie about time, you get
    a +1 to the roll.</p>
    <p><strong>FOR THE GM:</strong> Talents allow you to codify narrow, specific
    things the character is good at for later reference, to
    reinforce the fiction, and they’re both prescriptive and
    descriptive. Talents should be interpreted in context of the
    fiction, and carefully. For example…</strong>
    <p>…Talent [Exceptionally Risky Parkour] applies during a
    climb up crates and a desperate leap for a fire escape</p>
    <p>…Talent [Dodge the Bigger Guy] counts when sliding under
    the ogre’s swing (but not for hacking and slashing him)</p>
    <p>…Talent [Drive Too Fast] will help with making a hard left
    while going 80mph in the rain</p>
