    <p>When you<strong> use extaordinary powers to do something consitent with your premise or established abilities</strong>, roll
    +STAT.</p>
    <p>This is the Move that triggers when you have supernatural
    abilities and you’re trying to do something you should be
    able to do, given what you are, but that isn’t explicitly spelled
    out in the rules. It allows you to represent your premise, even
    if you don’t yet have advanced moves from your paths.<p>
    <p?“Bad news, those two werewolves have followed you out to the
    parking lot, and they’re joking about staking you out for the
    sun,” the GM says.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been a vampire for like two nights,” Charlie complains.
    “I’m going to go crazy on them, just vamp out.”<p>
    <p>“You don’t have that move yet, but that’s how you described
    Elliot when he lost control feeding earlier, right? So that’s part
    of your premise,” the GM says. “Sounds like Manifest Power.”</p>
    <p>A 10, and Charlie picks “lose a resource”. The GM nods. “As you
    teeter on the edge of control, you can feel you’re running
    through Blood way faster than you should be. What do you do?”</p>
    <p>Remember to always use the most specific Move you’ve got!</p>
