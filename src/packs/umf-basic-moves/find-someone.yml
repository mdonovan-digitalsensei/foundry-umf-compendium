    <p>When you go looking for someone who can help you,
    roll+CHA. On a 10+, you find them and they’re open to
    negotiation. On a 7-9, they’re in trouble or dealing with a
    problem when you get there, or you have to settle for a lesser
    version like an assistant or protege.</p>
    <p>Use this move when you need information, help, gear, or
    similar, either to find someone you already know
    (whether or not they’ve made an appearance in the fiction), or
    someone new.</p>
    <p><strong>FOR THE GM:</strong> Remember to ask questions and use the
    answers.</p>
    <p>If the field Scientist asks you, “do I know anyone from my
    college who is an expert in Egyptology?” feel free to ask them
    in return, “do you? Are you rivals for the same tenure?”.</p>
