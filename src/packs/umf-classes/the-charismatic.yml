    <p>Attractive. Magnetic. Vivacious. The Charismatic knows
    people they can talk into making their lives easier, or talk into
    getting them what they want, either by calling in old debts or
    just by being charming.</p>
    <p>The Manipulator pushes buttons and manipulates to get their
    way; the Celebrity does it through being a literal celebrity.</p>
    <p>Consider dipping into Dedicated for detecting skills and
    empathy, or into Fast to get out of the trouble your mouth will
    talk you into.</p>
