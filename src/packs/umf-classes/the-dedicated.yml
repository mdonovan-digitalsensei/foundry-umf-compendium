    <p>The Dedicated is all about knowing people in an authentic
    way, unlike the Charismatic who is more about manipulation.
    Theyâ€™ve been around the block a few times, are keenly
    empathetic, or are very well-trained.</p>
    <p>The Investigator is the quintessential detective, the guy in the
    rumpled suit or in the starched uniform. The Organizer is a
    neighborhood fixture who knows everyone, a streetwise
    paladin for the dark streets.</p>
    <p>Both paths benefit from dips into Tough, to keep them alive,
    and from Charismatic, to get people moving the way they
    want them to.</p>
