    <p>The Fast is all about being fast, whether that’s sizing up a
    situation before it gets dangerous and then getting out of it
    unscathed or shooting first. The Rogue is the classic thief,
    with moves to stay unnoticed in a crowd and to sneak into
    places they shouldn’t be. The Gunslinger is preternaturally
    good with a ranged weapon.</p>
    <p>You’ll find Tough’s ability to size up the opposition and take a
    beating useful, but consider Dedicated’s Organizer or
    Charismatic’s Celebrity to expand your range.</p>
