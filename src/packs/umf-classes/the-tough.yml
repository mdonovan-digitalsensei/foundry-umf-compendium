    <p>The Tough chooses how they’re tough – mentally, physically,
    or emotionally – and in that area they’re almost untouchable.
    The Bruiser’s all about taking a beating and getting up for more,
    while the Daredevil takes defying danger up to the next level.
    Tough plays well with Dedicated, for that weeble-wobble pulp
    detective feel, but any of the other paths has something to
    offer you..</p>
