    <p>The Strong is all about displaying strength, from a signature
    melee weapon to hitting obscenely hard to impressing people
    with their muscle.</p>
    <p>The Weapon Expert puts the signature weapon to good use,
    applying strength in a controlled fashion, while the Athlete is
    all about being a comeback kid.</p>
    <p>The natural pair for Strong is Tough or Fast, making those
    toe-to-toe slugfests with a werewolf a little more survivable â€“
    but Dedicated has a lot to offer too.</p>
