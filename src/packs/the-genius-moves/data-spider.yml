  description: >-
    <p>You have a program that monitors the internet for the answer to a
    specific question that can be found or pieced together from
    available data, like “where are the vampires smuggling heroin into
    the city” or “is anyone showing undue interest in Egyptian
    artifacts”.
    When you take a few hours to set up a query, say how you receive
    notices; the next time two dice match, on any roll, by any player,
    you’ll get an alert with the information, though it might not be as
    complete as it could be. Choose if your spider keeps running on the
    same query or not.</p>
