    <p>Nobody gets this far without making friends and enemies. When
    you remember something useful to the situation at hand that
    someone once told you, choose who told you: a mentor, friend,
    enemy, or ex-lover. Name them, then take +1 forward to act on it. If
    the GM tells you itâ€™s flawed, inaccurate, or flat-out wrong, mark XP
    if you act on it, instead.</p>
