  description: >-
    <p>You know how to use an exotic melee weapon most people don’t,
    and yours is special. Maybe it’s forged from part of your soul or
    maybe it’s just really, really old. You start out with it, and, should it
    ever be lost, you know how to replace it. Tell the GM what it is and
    how you acquired it, and the GM will tell you if there will be any
    complications to carrying it openly and, if it comes up, what kind of
    effort it’ll take to replace it.</p>
    <p>Use the Fighter’s signature weapon to build yours.</p>
