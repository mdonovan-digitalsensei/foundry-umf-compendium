    <p>If you’re circled by a group of foes, when you hack and slash, if you
    deal damage, you can choose to do your damage twice as long as
    the total damage is divided up between at least two of them. If
    you’re fighting a horde or similar abstraction, instead do an
    additional 1d6 damage.</p>
