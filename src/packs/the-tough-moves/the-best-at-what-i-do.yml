    <p>Choose another Move you know. When you use that Move in
    combat, you get two benefits, chosen by the GM now.</p> 
    <ul>
    <li>you get one bonus hold for it or it costs one hold less than usual</li> 
    <li>you can use it once per combat without rolling for it or as if you’d rolled a 10+</li> 
    <li>you roll it with +1, and +2 damage or double damage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The GM may offer you a different option or decline to choose any;
    if you can’t agree, choose another Move instead of this one.</p>
