    <p>Choose one area you’re especially tough in, like emotionally,
    physically, or mentally. When your HP reaches max, hold 3 Grit,
    losing any you already had. You can spend one Grit to halve an
    attack’s effect or damage if you can explain how being tough in
    that area would help.</p>
