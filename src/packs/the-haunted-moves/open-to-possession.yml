    <p>When you take a spirit into your body, gain Spirit hold equal
    to the better of your CON or WIS, plus 1. You learn what it
    wants and what it excelled at in life, if anything. Spend this
    hold to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>succeed at a task the spirit excelled at in life</li>
    <li>ignore a compulsion or mind-affecting effect</li>
    <li>heal yourself or someone else by 2d6</li>
    <li>evict a spirit from your body</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you run out of hold, the spirit attempts to take over to
    pursu its own business or leaves, GMâ€™s choice.</p>
