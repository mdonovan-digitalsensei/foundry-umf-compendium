  description: >-
    <p>You have a form that’s more or less human. You can switch
    into it when you wish; nobody who matters will be fooled for
    long, but mortals can’t tell the difference. You use your own
    stats and have all your own abilities except for those that
    require your natural form (GM’s call). Your human form is
    unique to you, as if you’d been born human.</p>
    <p>Choose two triggers, like the touch of cold iron or a strongly
    presented crucifix or being touched by sunlight; when this
    occurs, you revert to your natural form until it’s no longer true.</p>
