  description: >-
    <p>You pick up emotions from those around you at all times.
    When you’re empathizing, intuiting motives, or trying to
    figure out what someone wants, take +1. When you spend a
    few moments within reach of someone, you can spout lore
    about them, in the context of how they are feeling now, using
    WIS instead of INT.</p>
    <p>When you focus your senses on someone within close range,
    you may ask their player, “what’s your deepest emotional need?”
    and “what’s your strongest desire right now?” and the player
    will answer truthfully, even if the character doesn’t know.</p>
