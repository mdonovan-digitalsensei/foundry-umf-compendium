    <p>When you turn your Seeming up to eleven to induce a specific
    emotion, roll+CHA. On a 10+, anyone looking at you feels that
    emotion strongly; they will act as you would expect them to
    act, given who they are. On a 7-9, the GM will offer you a hard
    bargain, ugly choice, or worse outcome. On a 12+, say how
    they are overwhelmed; if the GM disagrees, mark XP.</p>
