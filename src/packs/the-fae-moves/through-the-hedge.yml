    <p>You may slip into the ancient hedge maze that separates
    Faerie from the Real through any opening that separates two
    distinct places. When you do, roll+WIS. On a 10+, you step
    back out where you wish to be, you are not in a bad spot or
    late, and nothing followed you. On a 7-9, choose two.</p>
