    <p>You are no longer limited to a normalized facade with your
    Seeming; from a burning coal to a ragged beggar, your
    Seeming is under your command and you may opt to change
    it when you wish with a momentâ€™s thought. However, it will be
    much less effective against anyone who sees you change, and
    you always retain a specific mark of your true self.</p>
