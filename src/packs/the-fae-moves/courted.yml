    <p>You spent time in Faerie. Hours, years, centuries –
    time flows differently there. You’re as familiar with Faerie
    as anyone who wasn’t actually born there, but
    someone or something of Faerie wants you back. Take
    +1 when enduring injustice, feigning obedience, or
    escaping from anything.</p>
