    <p>You have faerie magic clinging to you, and you can’t get out
    from under it. Choose a Seeming, like old curmudgeon, demure
    wallflower, or adorable child; this is who most mortals (and
    supernaturals who aren’t paying close attention) will think
    you are.</p>
    <p>Even if shown evidence to the contrary, they’ll rationalize it
    away, though they won’t forget things they already knew or
    let you stab them twice. You’re stuck with it. If you’re ever
    stripped of it in play permanently, replace this Move
    immediately with a new one.</p>
