  description: >-
    <p>You have a Seeming, a normalized facade, that hides your true
    nature, like girl next door, friendly salesman, or helpful
    librarian. When mortals (and supernaturals who aren’t paying
    close attention) look at you, that’s what they see, unless given
    serious cause to doubt.</p>
    <p>When you pass your Seeming off as truth against someone
    who might see through it, roll+WIS or +CHA. On a 10+, they
    don’t notice what you wish them not to or believe what you
    wish them to about you, your choice. On a 7-9, the GM will
    tell you what confirmation they require.</p>
