    <p>You have a lab or base where you can work on your interests in
    relative peace and quiet. Pick two:</p> 
    <ul>
    <li>a research library with two areas of focus; +1 to research them</li> 
    <li>a huge pile of junk; you can always find a spare part that’ll work </li>
    <li>a search engine you’ve programmed yourself; it’s not AI but it’s close. Take +1 when you search the internet for information.</li>
    </ul>
